# axe-playground

A series of fixtures meant to violate specific [aXe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) rules and checks. Supports modification of aXe configuration, and test fixtures themselves, on the fly.

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Getting Started

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:isner/axe-playground.git

$ npm i
$ npm start
```

Open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Adding Fixtures

There is currently no support for adding fixtures, but it's on the to-do list.
